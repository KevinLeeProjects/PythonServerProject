# PythonServerProject

This Python code sets up a server that handles location and information requests. It processes commands like "IAMAT" to report client locations and "WHATSAT" to retrieve information about nearby places using the Google Places API. The server is designed for use in a distributed system where servers exchange data and respond to client requests.
